# Task-05: Neural Style Transfer

This project is part of my Generative AI Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

In this task, Neural Style Transfer is used to apply the artistic style of
one image to the content of another image using a pre-trained VGG19 model.

The project demonstrates how deep learning models can be used to generate
artistic images.
